    <p>Crispy pork belly is <strong>all the rage</strong>, thanks to social media, food bloggers, and celebrity chefs with too much time on their hands. 
        It's a common sight on menus across the land; you can't channel-surf past a food show without seeing it. <p>It also helps that people are no longer terrified to eat a little fat.</p>    

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>½ pound whole pork belly, skin removed</ul>
     <ul>½ teaspoon smoked paprika, or to taste</ul>    
     <ul> kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</ul>
     <ul>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</ol>
     <ol>Season pork belly all over with smoked paprika, salt and black pepper.</ol>
     <ol>Wrap pork in parchment paper; wrap a second time in aluminum foil; wrap a third time in another sheet of aluminum foil.</ol>
     <ol>Place pork packet in a baking dish.</ol>
     <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 6 hours. Let cool in wrappings to room temperature; place cooled packet in the refrigerator and chill for 8 hours to overnight.</ol>
     <ol>Unwrap chilled pork; reserve any rendered fat that falls away when unwrapping pork.</ol>
     <ol>Cut pork into 6 equal portions. Cut 1/8x1/8-inch slashes in the fat-side of pork. Season with salt.</ol>
     <ol>Heat 2 tablespoons reserved pork fat in a skillet over medium heat. Place pork belly, fat-side down, in hot fat; cook until browned on all sides and heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.</ol>
     <ol>Transfer pork belly to a plate, drizzle with olive oil, and season with pepper.</ol>
