    <p>This is the best banana bread recipe I have found. It is the <strong>most successful and versatile</strong> quick bread! 
        You can also customize and use chunky applesauce or a 15-ounce can of pumpkin for wonderful variations.</p>    

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>1 cup white sugar</ul>
     <ul>½ cup margarine, softened</ul>    
     <ul>2 large eggs</ul>
     <ul>1 ½ cups mashed banana</ul>
     <ul>2 cups all-purpose flour</ul>
     <ul>1 teaspoon baking soda</ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</ol>
     <ol>Beat sugar and margarine in a bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs, then bananas. Add flour and baking soda, stirring just until combined. Pour into the prepared pan.</ol>
     <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from the pan and let cool.</ol>
     <ol>Store in the refrigerator or freeze.</ol>
